# A.L.I.C.E. PROJECT

This is an entertainment project, inspired by the following two:

* Stanford PhD Candidate Joon's Generative AI HCI research
* Alice and stress test settings in Underworld of Japanese anime Sword Art Online

The project's planned FEATURES are as follows:

* 2D version of Underworld
* Initial residents settings
* Players can sneak into the setting, and players can talk to residents to "pollute" residents' memories and impulses
* In the center of the map is a church, a top-down manager, managing the thinking of local residents; when the church finds someone has an idea that violates the rules (the discovery must be made by the church's police during interaction and patrol, and the church cannot directly scan other residents' minds)

The goals of the project are as follows:

* Stress test: 300 years later, monsters from the demon world will invade the town, and the goal of the town residents and the church is to resist the attack of the demon world
